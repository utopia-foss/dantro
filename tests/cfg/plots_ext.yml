# Configuration for PlotManager test with "external" plot creator

# This can be used to couple to external methods and use the PlotManager only
# as a basic configuration frontend.

  # Specify the module to find the function in

  # And the name of the plot function within that package
  plot_func: lineplot

  # The data manager is passed to that function as first positional argument.
  # Also, the generated output path is passed as `out_path` keyword argument.

  # All further kwargs on this level are passed on to that function.

  # It is also possible to import a plot function from a file, e.g. a module
  # that might not have been installed.

  # Specify the module to import via absolute or relative path
  module_file: test_module.py
  # NOTE Relative path can only be used if the PlotCreator was initialized
  #      with the `custom_modules_base_dir` argument; this can be passed via
  #      the `common_creator_kwargs` option to all instances of this class.

  plot_func: write_something
  
  # This function does not actually plot something but just writes the kwargs
  # that now follow to a file
