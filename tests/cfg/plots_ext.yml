# Configuration for PlotManager test with "custom" plot creator
#
# This can be used to couple to external methods and use the PlotManager only
# as a basic configuration frontend.
---
from_func:
  # Use a custom plot function from an already importable module

  # Specify the module to find the function in and the plot function
  module: .basic
  plot_func: test_func
  # NOTE This requires that the module is importable, i.e.: installed.

  # The data manager is passed to that function as first positional argument,
  # or, if that fails, as `data` keyword argument.
  # Also, the generated output path is passed as `out_path` keyword argument.
  # All further kwargs on this level are passed on to that function.

from_file:
  # It is also possible to import a plot function from a file, e.g. a module
  # that might not have been installed.

  # Specify the module to import via absolute or relative path
  module_file: module.py
  # NOTE Relative path can only be used if the PlotCreator was initialized
  #      with the `custom_modules_base_dir` argument; this can be passed via
  #      the `common_creator_kwargs` option to all instances of this class.
