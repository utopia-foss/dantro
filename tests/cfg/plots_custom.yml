# Configuration for PlotManager test with "custom" plot creator
---
custom:
  # Use a custom plot function
  # This can be used to couple to external methods and use the PlotManager only
  # as a basic configuration frontend.
  mode: custom

  # Specify the module string to find the function at.
  plot_func: my_module.my_plot_func
  # NOTE This requires that the module is importable, i.e.: installed.

  # The data manager is passed to that function as first positional argument,
  # or, if that fails, as `data` keyword argument.
  # All further kwargs on this level are passed on to that function.

from_file:
  # It is also possible to import a plot function from a file
  mode: custom

  # Specify the module to import via absolute or relative path
  module_file: /abs/path/to/module.py
  # NOTE Relative path can only be used if PlotManager was initialized with the
  #      `custom_modules_base_dir` argument.

  plot_func: my_plot_func
