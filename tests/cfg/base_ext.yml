  # The data manager is passed to that function as first positional argument.
  # Also, the generated output path is passed as `out_path` keyword argument.

  # All further kwargs on this level are passed on to that function.

  # that might not have been installed.

  # Specify the module to import via absolute or relative path

  # NOTE Relative path can only be used if the PlotCreator was initialized
  #      with the `custom_modules_base_dir` argument; this can be passed via
  #      the `common_creator_kwargs` option to all instances of this class.

  # This function does not actually plot something but just writes the kwargs
  # that now follow to a file
