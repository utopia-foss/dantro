# Possible data selectors of the ParamSpaceGroup

# The following selects _only_ a field and does not change the subspace

    - foo
    - bar
    - state

non_numeric:

# Can also select multiple fields, which will then be named after the given key

    randints:
      - foo

# specifying locations.
