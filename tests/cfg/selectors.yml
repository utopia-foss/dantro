# Possible data selectors of the ParamSpaceGroup
---
# The following selects _only_ a field and does not change the subspace
field_only:
  field:
    - foo
    - bar
    - randints

non_numeric:
  field:
    - cfg  

# .............................................................................

# This selector shows the short syntax of selecting a subspace
# The result is an xarray with two named dimensions, p1 and p2. Dimension p0
# no longer has an extend and is thus squeezed away. Each entry in the xarray
# is the corresponding data at the cfg key
subspace_selector:
  subspace:
    p0:
      idx: 1
    p1:
      mask: [true, false, true]
    p2:
      mask: !slice [2]
  
  field:
    - foo
    - bar
    - randints

# There is a short syntax available for the subsace selector
short_syntax:
  subspace:
    p0: 1
    p1: [true, false, true]
    p2: !slice [2]

  field: foo/bar/randints

# The names of the dimensions need not be those of the parameter dimensions
renaming:
  subspace:
    param0:
      name: [p0]  # anything that ParamSpace can extract the name from
      idx: 1
    param1:
      name: [p1]
      mask: [true, false, true]
    param2:
      name: [p2]
      mask: !slice [2]

  field: foo/bar/randints

# It is possible to access entries that are deeper down in the hierarchy, even
# within containers... basically, as long as item access is possible.
