    Especially, this group maintains the correct order of members according to
    integer ordering.

    To speed up element insertion, this group keeps track of recently added
    container names, which are then used as hints for subsequent insertions.

        Albeit the members of this group being ordered, item access still
        refers to the *names* of the members, not their index within the

    .. warning::

        With the underlying ordering mechanism of
        :py:class:`~dantro.utils.ordereddict.KeyOrderedDict`, the performance
        of this data structure is sensitive to the insertion order of elements.

        It is fastest for **in-order** insertions, where the complexity per
        insertion is constant (regardless of whether insertion order is
        ascending or descending).
        For **out-of-order** insertions, the whole key map may have to be
        searched, in which case the complexity scales with the number of
        elements in this group.

        **sort elements before adding them to this group**.
