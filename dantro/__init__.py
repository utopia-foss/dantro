""":py:mod:`dantro` provides a uniform interface for hierarchically structured
and semantically heterogeneous data.
It is built around three main features:

- **data handling**: loading heterogeneous data into a tree-like data
  structure, providing a uniform interface to it
- **data transformation**: performing arbitrary operations on the data, if
  necessary using lazy evaluation
- **data visualization**: creating a visual representation of the processed
  data

Together, these stages constitute a **data processing pipeline**:
an automated sequence of predefined, configurable operations.

See :ref:`the user manual <welcome>` for more information.
