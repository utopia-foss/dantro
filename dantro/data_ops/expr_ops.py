    """Parses and evaluates a symbolic math expression using SymPy.

    For parsing, uses sympy's :py:func:`sympy.parsing.sympy_parser.parse_expr`.
    The ``symbols`` are provided as ``local_dict``; the ``global_dict`` is not
    explicitly set and subsequently uses the sympy default value, containing
    all basic sympy symbols and notations.

    .. note::

        The expression given here is not Python code, but symbolic math.
        You cannot call arbitrary functions, but only those that are imported
        by ``from sympy import *``.

    .. hint::

        When using this expression as part of the :ref:`dag_framework`, it is
        attached to a so-called :ref:`syntax hook <dag_op_hooks_integration>`
        that makes it easier to specify the ``symbols`` parameter.
        See :ref:`here <dag_op_hook_expression>` for more information.

    .. warning::

        While the expression is symbolic math, be aware that smypy by default
        interprets the ``^`` operator as XOR, not an exponentiation!
        For exponentiation, use the ``**`` operator or adjust the
        ``transformations`` argument as specified in the sympy documentation.

    .. warning::

        The return object of this operation will *only* contain symbolic sympy
        objects if ``astype is None``. Otherwise, the type cast will evaluate
        all symbolic objects to the numerical equivalent specified by the given
        ``astype``.

    Args:
        expr (str): The expression to evaluate
        symbols (dict, optional): The symbols to use
        evaluate (bool, optional): Controls whether sympy evaluates ``expr``.
            This *may* lead to a fully evaluated result, but does not guarantee
            that no sympy objects are contained in the result. For ensuring
            a fully numerical result, see the ``astype`` argument.
        transformations (Tuple[Callable], optional): The ``transformations``
            argument for sympy's
            :py:func:`sympy.parsing.sympy_parser.parse_expr`. By default, the
            sympy standard transformations are performed.
        astype (Union[type, str], optional): If given, performs a cast to this
            data type, fully evaluating all symbolic expressions.
            Default: Python :py:class:`float`.

    Raises:
        TypeError: Upon failing ``astype`` cast, e.g. due to free symbols
            remaining in the evaluated expression.
        ValueError: When parsing of ``expr`` failed.

    Returns:
        The result of the evaluated expression.

def generate_lambda(expr: str) -> Callable:

    callables in other operations.

    The ``expr`` argument needs to be a valid Python
    `lambda expression <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#lambda>`_.

    Inside the lambda body, the following names are available for use:

        * A large part of the ``builtins`` module
        * Every name from the Python ``math`` module, e.g. ``sin``, ``cos``, â€¦
        * These modules (and their long form): ``np``, ``xr``, ``scipy``

    Internally, this uses ``eval`` but imposes the following restrictions:

        * The following strings may *not* appear in ``expr``: ``;``, ``__``.
        * There can be no nested ``lambda``, i.e. the only allowed lambda
          string is that in the beginning of ``expr``.
        * The dangerous parts from the ``builtins`` module are *not* available.

    Args:
        expr (str): The expression string to evaluate into a lambda.

    Returns:
        Callable: The generated Callable.

    Raises:
        SyntaxError: Upon failed evaluation of the given expression, invalid
            expression pattern, or disallowed strings in the lambda body.
