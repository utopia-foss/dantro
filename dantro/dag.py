class Transformation:
    """A transformation is the collection of an N-ary operation and its inputs.

    Transformation objects store the name of the operation that is to be
    carried out and the arguments that are to be fed to that operation. After
    a Transformation is defined, the only interaction with them is via the
    ``compute`` method.

    For computation, the arguments are recursively inspected for whether there
    are any DAGReference-derived objects; these need to be resolved first,
    meaning they are looked up in the DAG's object database and -- if they are
    another Transformation object -- their result is computed. This can lead
    to a traversal along the DAG.

    .. warning::

        Objects of this class should under *no* circumstances be changed after
        they were created! For performance reasons, the
        :py:attr:`~dantro.dag.Transformation.hashstr` property is cached; thus,
        changing attributes that are included into the hash computation will
        not lead to a new hash, thus silently creating wrong behaviour.

        All relevant attributes (operation, args, kwargs, salt) are thus set
        read-only. This should be respected!

        Args:
            operation (str): The operation that is to be carried out.

                for the operation.
            kwargs (Dict[str, Union[DAGReference, Any]]): Keyword arguments
                for the operation. These are internally stored as a
                :py:class:`~dantro.utils.ordereddict.KeyOrderedDict`.
            dag (TransformationDAG, optional): An associated DAG that is needed
                for object lookup. Without an associated DAG, args or kwargs
                may NOT contain any object references.
            salt (int, optional): A hashing salt that can be used to let this
                specific Transformation object have a different hash than other
                objects, thus leading to cache misses.
            file_cache (dict, optional): File cache options. Expected keys are
                ``write`` (boolean or dict) and ``read`` (boolean or dict).
                Note that the options given here are NOT reflected in the hash
                of the object!

                The following arguments are possible under the ``read`` key:

                    enabled (bool, optional):
                        Whether it should be attempted to read from the file
                        cache.
                    load_options (dict, optional):
                        Passed on to the method that loads the cache,
                        :py:meth:`~dantro.data_mngr.DataManager.load`.

                Under the ``write`` key, the following arguments are possible.
                They are evaluated in the order that they are listed here.
                See :py:meth:`~dantro.dag.Transformation._cache_result` for
                more information.

                        Whether writing is enabled at all
                    always (bool, optional):
                        If given, will always write.
                    allow_overwrite (bool, optional):
                        If False, will not write a cache file if one already
                        exists. If True, a cache file *might* be written,
                        although one already exists. This is still conditional
                        on the evaluation of the other arguments.
                    min_size (int, optional):
                        The *minimum* size of the result object that allows
                        writing the cache.
                    max_size (int, optional):
                        The *maximum* size of the result object that allows
                        writing the cache.
                    min_compute_time (float, optional):
                        The minimal individual computation time of this node
                        that is needed in order for the file cache to be
                        written.
                        *Note* that this value can be lower if the node result
                        is not computed but looked up from the cache.
                    min_cumulative_compute_time (float, optional):
                        The minimal cumulative computation time of this node
                        and all its dependencies that is needed in order for
                        the file cache to be written.
                        *Note* that this value can be lower if the node result
                        is not computed but looked up from the cache.

                        Passed on to the cache storage method,
                        :py:meth:`dantro.dag.TransformationDAG._write_to_cache_file`.
                        The following arguments are available:

                        ignore_groups (bool, optional):
                            Whether to store groups. Disabled by default.
                        attempt_pickling (bool, optional):
                            Whether it should be attempted to store results
                            that could not be stored via a dedicated storage
                            function by pickling them. Enabled by default.
                        raise_on_error (bool, optional):
                            Whether to raise on error to store a result.
                            Disabled by default; it is useful to enable this
                            when debugging.
                        pkl_kwargs (dict, optional):
                            Arguments passed on to the pickle.dump function.

        specified transformations configuration into it.

        Args:
            dm (DataManager): The associated data manager
            select (dict, optional): Selection specifications, which are
                translated into regular transformations based on ``getitem``
                operations. The ``base_transform`` and ``select_base``
                arguments can be used to define from which object to select.
                By default, selection happens from the associated DataManager.
            transform (Sequence[dict], optional): Transform specifications.
            cache_dir (str, optional): The name of the cache directory to
                create if file caching is enabled. If this is a relative path,
                it is interpreted relative to the associated data manager's
                data directory. If it is absolute, the absolute path is used.
                The directory is only created if it is needed.
            file_cache_defaults (dict, optional): Default arguments for file
                caching behaviour. This is recursively updated with the
                arguments given in each individual select or transform
                specification.
            base_transform (Sequence[Transformation], optional): A sequence of
                transform specifications that are added to the DAG prior to
                those added via ``select`` and ``transform``. These can be used
                to create some other object from the data manager which should
                be used as the basis of ``select`` operations.
                These transformations should be kept as simple as possible
                and ideally be only used to traverse through the data tree.
            select_base (Union[DAGReference, str], optional): Which tag to
                base the ``select`` operations on. If None, will use the
                (always-registered) tag for the data manager, ``dm``. This
                attribute can also be set via the ``select_base`` property.
            select_path_prefix (str, optional): If given, this path is prefixed
                to all ``path`` specifications made within the ``select``
                argument. Note that unlike setting the ``select_base`` this
                merely joins the given prefix to the given paths, thus leading
                to repeated path resolution. For that reason, using the
                ``select_base`` argument is generally preferred and the
                ``select_path_prefix`` should only be used if ``select_base``
                is already in use.
                If this path ends with a ``/``, it is directly prepended. If
                not, the ``/`` is added before adjoining it to the other path.
            meta_operations: Meta-operations are basically *function
                definitions* using the language of the transformation
                framework; for information on how to define and use them, see
                :ref:`dag_meta_ops`.
            verbosity (str, optional): Logging verbosity during computation.
                This mostly pertains to the extent of statistics being emitted
                through the logger.

                    - ``0``: No statistics
                    - ``1``: Per-node statistics (mean, std, min, max)
