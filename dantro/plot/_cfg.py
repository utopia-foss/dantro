    """Resolves the ``based_on`` entries of *all* plot configurations in the
    given plot configurations dictionary ``plots_cfg``.

    The procedure is as follows:

        - Iterate over root-level entries in the ``plots_cfg`` dict
        - For each entry, check if a ``based_on`` entry is present and needs
          to be resolved.
        - If so, recursively resolve the configuration entry, starting from the
          first entry in the ``based_on`` sequence and recursively updating it
          with content of the following elements. The final recursive update
          is that of the plot configuration given in ``plots_cfg``.

    Lookups happen from a pool of plot configurations: the ``base_pools``,
    combined with the given ``plots_cfg`` itself. The ``based_on`` entries are
    looked up by name using the following rules:

        - Other plot configurations within ``plots_cfg`` have highest
          precedence.
        - If no name is found there, lookups happen from within ``base_pools``,
          iterating over it *in reverse*, meaning that entries later in the
          ordered dict take precedence over those earlier.
        - If entries in a base pool are again using ``based_on``, these will be
          looked up using the same rules, but with the pool restricted to
          entries *with lower precedence* than that pool.
        - Lookups within the same pool will exclude the name of the currently
          updated plot configuration.
          Example: ``some_plot: {based_on: some_plot}`` will look for
          ``some_plot`` in some lower-precedence pool.

    The resolution of plot configurations works on deep copies of the given
    ``plots_cfg`` and all the ``based_on`` entries to avoid mutability issues
    between parts of these highly nested dictionaries.

    For integrated use of this functionality, see :ref:`plot_cfg_inheritance`.

    Args:
        plots_cfg (dict): A dict with multiple plot configurations to resolve
            the ``based_on`` entries of. Root-level keys are assumed to
            correspond to individual plot configurations.
            If this argument evaluates to False, will silently assume an empty
            plots configuration.
        label (str): The label to use for the given plots configuration when
            adding it to the base configuration pool.
        base_pools (Union[OrderedDict, Sequence[Tuple[str, dict]]]): The base
            configuration pools to look up the ``based_on`` entries in. This
            needs to be an OrderedDict or a type that can be converted into
            one. Keys will be used as labels for the individual pools.
            The order of this pool is relevant, see above.

        PlotConfigError: Upon missing ``based_on`` values or dependency loops.
