# dantro

The `dantro` package — from *data* and *dentro* (gr., for tree) – is a Python package to work with hierarchically organised data.
It allows loading possibly heterogeneous data into a tree-like structure that can be conveniently handled for data manipulation, analysis, plotting, ... you name it.

It emerged as an abstraction of the [`deval`](https://ts-gitlab.iup.uni-heidelberg.de/yunus/deval) package and focusses on the loading of data and supplying convenient classes to work with.
While being developed alongside the [Utopia project](https://ts-gitlab.iup.uni-heidelberg.de/utopia/utopia), it aims to remain general enough to be usable outside of that context.
