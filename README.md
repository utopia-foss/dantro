# dantro

The `dantro` package (from *dentro*, gr., for tree) is a Python package to load hierarchical data into a tree-like structure.

It emerged as an abstraction of the [`deval`](https://ts-gitlab.iup.uni-heidelberg.de/yunus/deval) package and focusses on the loading of data and supplying convenient classes to work with.  
At the same time, it aims to remain abstract and usable outside of the context of Utopia. Consequently, all specialisations happen outside of this package.
