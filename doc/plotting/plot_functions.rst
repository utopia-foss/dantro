Plot Functions
==============

This page gives an overview of plot functions that are implemented within :py:mod:`dantro` for the use with :ref:`pcr_ext` and derived plot creators.
These plot functions are meant to be as generic as possible, allowing to work with a wide variety of data.
They make use of the :ref:`dag_framework` for :ref:`plot_creator_dag`.

To use these plot functions, the following information needs to be specified in the plot configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

    my_plot:
      creator: external      # or: universe, multiverse, ...
      module: .generic       # absolute: dantro.plot_creators.ext_funcs.generic
      plot_func: facet_grid  # or: errorbar, errorbands, ...

      # ...

.. _dag_generic_facet_grid:

:py:func:`~.facet_grid`: A Declarative Generic Plot Function
------------------------------------------------------------

Handling, transforming, and plotting high-dimensional data is difficult and often requires specialization to use-cases.
``dantro`` provides the generic :py:func:`~dantro.plot_creators.ext_funcs.generic.facet_grid` plot function that - together with the other dantro features - allows for a declarative way of creating plots from high-dimensional data.

The idea is that high-dimensional raw data first is transformed using the :ref:`dag_framework`.
The :py:func:`~.facet_grid` function then gets the ready-to-plot data as input and visualizes it by automatically choosing an appropriate kind of plot â€“ if possible and not explicitely given â€“ in a declarative way through specification of layout keywords such as ``col``\ ums, ``row``\ s, or ``hue``.
This approach is called `faceting <http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/plotting.html#faceting>`_; dantro makes use of the `excellent plotting functionality of xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/plotting.html>`_ for this feature.
The :py:func:`~.facet_grid` plot function further extends the xarray plotting functionality by adding the possibility to create :ref:`animations <pcr_ext_animations>`, simply by using the ``frames`` argument to specify the data dimension to represent as individual frames of an animation.

The :py:class:`~dantro.plot_creators._plot_helper.PlotHelper` interface then copes with the plot :ref:`style <pcr_ext_style>` and further layout.
All steps are fully configurable and optimized for the YAML-based plotting interface.
Thus, generating a plot of multidimensional data does not require touching any actual code but just specifying the desired representation in the plot configuration. ðŸŽ‰

.. _dag_generic_errorbar:

:py:func:`~.errorbar` and :py:func:`~.errorbands`: Visualizing Confidence Intervals
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The :py:func:`~.errorbar` and :py:func:`~.errorbands` plotting functions provide the ability to visualize data together with corresponding confidence intervals.
Similar to :py:func:`~.facet_grid`, these functions offer the ``hue`` and ``frames`` arguments, allowing to represent data with up to three dimensions.
