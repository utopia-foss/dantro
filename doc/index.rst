Welcome to dantro's documentation!
==================================

Here, you will find information on selected parts of the dantro package.

Furthermore, the documentation contains a full API reference, which makes all docstrings visible and, more importantly, searchable.
This is often a good starting point if some specific dantro functionality is unclear.

.. note::

    This documentation is very much work in progress.
